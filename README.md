Information about resilient gardens, rewilding, wildlife corridors and whatever that leads to.

This site is my personal [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/zettelkasten-improves-thinking-writing/).
It is my attempt to organize information as I read things by creating a network of concepts with lots of
interconnections.
I am not starting with any particular structure in mind. Instead, I am letting it self-organize through the
connections.

## Why is it called "Mycelia" when you don't write much about fungi?

I called this site "mycelia"
because "mycelia" is the network that connects fungi together (just as the Zettelkasten links connect topics together);
because Zettelkasten doesn't seem to do much for a while and then it suddenly bears fruit;
and because I think I will be reading a lot about soil quality and rebuilding soil and that fungi will be a critical part of that story.

I call the individual entries "hyphae" because the each individual fungal tendril is called a "hypha".

## Disclaimer

I am not an expert in any of this and, since I am building the site as I read things,
it may be incorrect, incomplete, biased, out of date, and links to the original sources will, inevitably break.
If you are an expert, I would welcome corrections.
