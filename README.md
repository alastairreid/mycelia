Information about resilient gardens, rewilding, wildlife corridors and whatever that leads to.

This site is my personal [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/zettelkasten-improves-thinking-writing/)
about things related to the above.
It is my attempt to organize information as I read things by creating a network of concepts with lots of
interconnections.
I am not starting with any particular structure in mind. Instead, I am letting it self-organize through the
connections.

I am not an expert in any of this and, since I am building the site as I read things,
it may be incorrect, incomplete, biased, out of date, and inks to my original sources will, inevitably break.
If you are an expert, I would welcome corrections.
