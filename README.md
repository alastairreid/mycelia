and whatever that leads to.

This site is my personal
<a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/mycelia/hyphae/zettelkasten.html">Zettelkasten</a>.
It is my attempt to organize information as I read things by creating a network of concepts with lots of interconnections.
I am not starting with any particular structure in mind. Instead, I am letting it self-organize through the connections.

## Why is it called "Mycelia" when you don't write much about fungi?

I called this site
"<a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/mycelia/hyphae/mycelia.html">mycelia</a>"
because mycelia is the network that connects fungi together (just as the
<a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/mycelia/hyphae/zettelkasten.html">Zettelkasten</a>
links connect topics together);
because Zettelkasten doesn't seem to do much for a while and then it suddenly bears fruit;
and because I think I will be reading a lot about
<a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/mycelia/hyphae/soil-health.html">soil health</a>,
and rebuilding soil and that
<a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/mycelia/hyphae/fungi.html">fungi</a>,
will be a critical part of that story.

I call the individual entries "<a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/mycelia/hyphae/index.html">hyphae</a>"
because each individual fungal tendril is called a "hypha".
