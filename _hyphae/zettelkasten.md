A system for dynamically organizing information as you learn it.
Used both to record the information and to help you make connections
between concepts.
See this [explanation].

(This website is a [Zettelkasten].)

Some key features

- Structured as a large number of relatively short pages where
  each page describes just one topic.
- Lots and lots of cross-linking within the Zettelkasten.
- Every link has a back-link because the more links, the more
  you understand how different concepts relate to each other.
  (I am not sure whether this is a required part of a Zettelkasten
  but it is how I build them.)
- Grows organically as information is learned.
  There is no need to start with an organization / taxonomy / hierarchy;
  the structure emerges dynamically as you add links between concepts.
  This makes Zettelkasten effective when you are just starting out
  and trying to make sense of a topic.

A [zettelkasten] is a lot like Wikipedia except that pages are much shorter:
if a page gets too long (more than a few paragraphs), you should move some of the information into
a new page and add/update links to point to that page.
