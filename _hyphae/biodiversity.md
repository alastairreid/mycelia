Having a large number of different species of
plants, animals and fungi in an environment.
(Note: it is really easy to only think of the species we can easily see and forget fungi, insects, worms, etc. - but those hard to see species are some
of the most important!)

Advantages

- Creates a richer ecosystem
- Improves [resilience] through
   - A Darwinian effect: even if some disaster strikes, some species will hopefully survive and thrive
   - Avoid single points of failure in the ecosystem
- It's more interesting
