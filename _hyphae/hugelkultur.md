Hügelkultur is the practice of burying wood to increase soil water retention.
A cross between a pile of rotting wood, a watering system and a raised bed for vegetables.

It is made by digging out an area of soil, layering in the wood (largest pieces at the bottom), and covering with mulch, leaf litter and soil.
Then you plant vegetables in it.
The heights of the mounds seem to be from 2-6 feet high and the height
will drop over time as the wood settles and the wood rots down.

The benefits are

- it is a carbon sink
- it improves soil quality (because it is sort of a compost heap and because the wood is broken down by fungi)
- it retains water (because rotting wood can hold a lot of water)
- in the first year, it will release some heat as the wood decomposes - this is good for the plants that you plant in it
- you are able to keep waste wood on site rather than spending energy/fuel to take it somewhere else
- gaps between the logs at the bottom provide shelter for various animals (eg frogs)

One thing to note is that the pile will reduce in size as the wood rots down and it is not structurally very strong so it is best for annual plants (because it will disturb the roots a bit as it changes) and it cannot be used as a water dam.
