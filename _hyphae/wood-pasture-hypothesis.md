Controversial hypothesis from the [Grazing ecology book] that the natural state of European (before humans had much influence) was a
wood pasture that was kept open by the action of large herbivores.
(The dominant theory is that the natural state is a closed canopy forest.)

Explored experimentally at [Oostvaardersplassen] and [Knepp farm].
