A book about [rewilding] a conventional intensive English farm (the [Knepp farm])
inspired by an understanding of [Mycorrhiza] and soil quality, and[Oostvaardersplassen] and a recognition that intensive farming was no longer financially viable.

It goes through the story of introducing large herbivores, taking fields out of production, (mostly negative) reactions to their project, persuading civil servants, working with their advisory board, etc.

Running through this is

- the richness of the ecosystem that they created (or, rather, that they allowed the large herbivores to create);
- the increase in [biodiversity] and return of rare species to the land;
- the surprising ecosystem connections discovered;
- the issue of the "shifting baseline" which has led naturalists to treat the habitat of 20-50 years ago as normal instead of going back to how things were before WW2, before heavy use of pesticides, fertilizers, antibiotics, etc. (eg old ornithology books describe the Nightingale quite differently from modern books because the Nightingale had to adapt to the loss of hedgerows, etc.)
