Restoring the environment to a natural state -- as it would be before human intervention.

Some of the challenges in rewilding are

- Climate change: what used to grow in an area may not survive in the current climate.
- Neighbouring areas: if neighbouring areas are not rewilded as well, then you will get 
  species migrating across the boundary.
- Species reintroduction: true rewilding might require the reintroduction of species that
  are extinct in that area. Your neighbours may have opinions if you want to reintroduce
  wolves, beaver, etc.
