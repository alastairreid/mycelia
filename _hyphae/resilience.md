Unlike a strict interpretation of [rewilding], a resilient environment is designed for likely current and future conditions including

- Increased temperature due to climate change
- Longer dry spells
- Higher winds
- Colder winters
- Increased weather variability

Some of the ways to make an environment resilient are

- increase [biodiversity]: at the very least, you will get a Darwinian effect of discovering what plants can survive in your space
- design in a way that can handle drought, wind, rain, cold, etc. and shelter plant and animals from extremes
